## Introduction (2 minutes)

### Opening
"Good morning/afternoon everyone! Thanks for joining today's demo of Sales Conversations Dashboard. 

Before we dive in, I'd like to quickly confirm - we have [list attendees and titles]. Perfect!

Based on our previous conversation, I understand your team is currently struggling with [mention their specific pain points]:
- [Pain point 1]
- [Pain point 2]
- [Pain point 3]

Today, I'm going to show you exactly how our dashboard solves these challenges. The demo will take about 20 minutes, and I encourage you to ask questions as we go."

---

## Part 1: Dashboard Overview (3 minutes)

### Navigate to Home Screen

**What to say:**
"So here's what you see when you first log into Sales Conversations Dashboard. Notice we have two main views - Pre-Sales and Post-Sales - accessible with one click.

Let me start by showing you the Pre-Sales dashboard, which is where your sales reps spend most of their time managing the pipeline."

### Click Pre-Sales Tab

**Point out:**
"Right at the top, you get these metric cards that give you an instant snapshot:
- Total prospects in your pipeline
- How many are high priority and need attention NOW
- Your total pipeline value - in this example, $240K
- Active deals currently in play

These update in real-time as your team makes progress."

**Pause for questions**

---

## Part 2: Pre-Sales Deep Dive (5 minutes)

### Show Conversation Cards

**What to say:**
"Now let's look at an individual prospect. Each card gives you everything you need at a glance."

### Click on Acme Corporation card

**Walk through:**
"For Acme Corporation, we can see:
- The company name and primary contact - John Smith
- Priority level - marked High in red, so this needs attention
- Current status - Active
- Contact details right here - email and phone
- The product they're interested in - Enterprise SaaS Platform
- Expected deal value - $50,000
- Current stage - Proposal Sent
- Last contact was November 12th
- Next follow-up is due November 15th - that's tomorrow, so your rep knows exactly what to do

And here's the really powerful part - see these notes? 'Interested in annual subscription. Requested custom integration options.' This context is crucial for the next conversation."

### Click "Messages" button

**Show conversation history:**
"Now if I click Messages, we see the complete conversation thread:
- John reached out on Nov 10 looking for a solution for 150 users
- Your rep responded within hours with a proposal
- John confirmed he received it and wants to schedule a demo

Everything in one place. No switching between email, CRM, and notes."

### Demonstrate Filtering

**What to say:**
"Now let's say I only want to see high-priority deals..."

**Apply High priority filter**

"There we go - instantly filtered to show just the hot opportunities. I can also filter by status, or combine filters. Want to see all high-priority pending deals? Done."

**Reset filters**

---

## Part 3: Post-Sales Dashboard (5 minutes)

### Click Post-Sales Tab

**What to say:**
"Alright, let's switch gears to Post-Sales. This is where your account managers and customer success team work.

Notice the metrics change here:
- Total accounts - 5 active customers
- At-Risk accounts - there's 1 that needs immediate attention
- Total contract value - $225K ARR
- Healthy accounts - 3 customers in good standing

This at-risk indicator is gold. It means you catch problems BEFORE they become cancellations."

### Show At-Risk Account

**Click on Innovate Solutions card:**
"Here's that at-risk account - Innovate Solutions. See it's marked in red?

Looking at the details:
- $40K contract - that's significant revenue
- Renewal date is January 20th - that's only two months away
- And look at these open tickets: 'Dashboard loading slowly' marked High Priority, 'Data export timing out'

The notes tell us: 'Experiencing performance issues. Need immediate attention to prevent churn.'

If you're using traditional tools, you might not see this until the customer calls to cancel. Here, you get early warning and can take action immediately."

### Show conversation thread

**Click Messages:**
"And you can see the entire support conversation. Lisa reported issues on Nov 12, your team escalated it, she's asking for updates today, and your account manager already responded with an ETA.

This transparency is what keeps customers from churning."

---

## Part 4: Customer Journey Timeline (5 minutes)

### Navigate to Healthy Account

**What to say:**
"Now let me show you one of the most powerful features - the Customer Journey Timeline. Let's look at a healthy account to see what success looks like."

### Click on Alpha Technologies, then "View Timeline"

**Pause for effect as modal opens**

"This is incredible. The complete customer journey visualized in one screen."

### Walk through metrics

**Point to each:**
"At the top, we have key metrics:
- 112 days from first contact to active customer
- 23 total touchpoints and activities
- 8 different people involved from both teams
- Final deal size: $115K ARR
- Status: Active Customer - healthy and green

Now look at this visual timeline..."

### Explain each phase

**Point and explain:**

"**October - Blue Phase** - Presales
- Lead generation through demo
- 6 activities: initial calls, discovery, product demos
- This is where your sales team qualifies and educates

**November - Green Phase** - Sales & Closed
- Proposal through signed contract
- 5 activities: pricing discussions, negotiations, legal review
- Deal successfully closed

**December - Purple Phase** - Onboarding
- Implementation and training
- 8 activities - notice more activities here, that's typical for onboarding
- Kickoff meetings, data migration, training sessions

**January - Light Blue Phase** - Active Customer
- Ongoing support and growth
- 4 activities: check-ins, adoption reviews, expansion discussions
- This is where you build long-term value"

### The Value

**What to say:**
"Here's why this matters: You can see patterns. If a deal gets stuck in the Proposal phase for too long, you know to intervene. If onboarding takes longer than 30 days, you can adjust your process. If successful customers all follow this pattern, you can replicate it.

You can also see exactly when a customer transitioned from sales to customer success, ensuring perfect handoffs."

### Filters

**Point to filter section:**
"And you can filter this view by opportunity, date range, or stage to analyze specific scenarios."

## Part 5: Recap & Q&A (5 minutes)

### Close the timeline and return to dashboard

**What to say:**
"Let me quickly recap what we've seen today:

**For Pre-Sales:**
- Complete pipeline visibility with real-time metrics
- Every prospect detail in one card
- Conversation history at your fingertips
- Smart filtering and prioritization
- Never miss a follow-up

**For Post-Sales:**
- Account health monitoring
- At-risk customer early warning
- Support ticket integration
- Renewal tracking
- Proactive issue resolution

**Customer Journey Timeline:**
- Visual lifecycle tracking
- Pattern identification
- Seamless handoffs
- Success replication

**And remember, this all works on any device - desktop, tablet, phone. Your team can access it anywhere.**"

### ROI Mention

"Based on what we typically see with customers of your size:
- Your reps currently spend about 2 hours a day searching for customer information - that's cut by 60%
- You're missing follow-ups that cost deals - this eliminates that
- At-risk accounts slip through - not anymore
- Your average sales cycle is probably [their number] days - our customers see a 25-30% reduction

So if you have [X] reps and you close [Y]% more deals while reducing churn by [Z]%, the ROI is significant."

### Open for Questions

**What to say:**
"Now, I'd love to hear your thoughts. What questions do you have? What would you want to see customized for your team?"

---

## Common Questions & Answers

### Q: "How do we get our existing data in?"
**A:** "Great question. We support CSV import, and we have direct integrations with major CRMs. For most teams, we can have your historical conversations imported within a day. We also have an API for custom integrations."

### Q: "What about training?"
**A:** "The interface is designed to be intuitive - you saw how easy it is to navigate. We provide a 1-hour training session for your team, plus documentation and video tutorials. Most users are productive on day one."

### Q: "Can we customize fields?"
**A:** "Yes! On the Professional plan, you can add custom fields. On Enterprise, we can customize workflows, add your branding, and even build custom integrations specific to your needs."

### Q: "What about mobile?"
**A:** "It's fully responsive. Let me resize this..." [demonstrate] "See how it adapts? Your team can check accounts, update notes, or view timelines from their phone."

### Q: "How secure is it?"
**A:** "We're SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR compliant, and all data is encrypted at rest and in transit. We also offer role-based access controls so you can limit who sees what."

### Q: "What's the pricing?"
**A:** "For a team like yours, the Professional plan at $99 per user per month would be ideal. That includes everything we showed today - both dashboards, unlimited conversations, the timeline feature, and priority support. 

Given your team size of [X] reps, we're talking about [X * $99] per month. 

Compare that to the revenue you're leaving on the table from missed follow-ups and churned customers - the ROI is typically 10-15x."

### Q: "Can we do a trial?"
**A:** "Absolutely! We offer a 30-day pilot program. We'll set up [X] users, import your data, and you can test it with real workflows. No commitment required. If you don't see value, no charge."

## Closing & Next Steps

### If interested:
**What to say:**
"Based on what you've seen and our conversation, I think this could be a game-changer for your team. Here's what I suggest:

**Option 1 - Pilot Program:**
Let's start with a 30-day pilot with [suggest 5-10 users]. We'll import your data, train your team, and measure the impact. If it works - and I'm confident it will - we roll it out to everyone. If not, no hard feelings.

**Option 2 - Full Deployment:**
If you're ready to move forward, we can have your entire team onboarded within a week.

Which approach makes more sense for you?"

### Schedule follow-up:
"Let me send you a calendar invite for [specific date/time] to discuss next steps. In the meantime, I'll email you:
- A recording of today's demo
- The one-pager summary
- A proposed implementation timeline
- Pilot program details

Sound good?"

### If need more time:
"No problem at all. What additional information would be helpful? Would you like:
- A demo for other team members?
- References from similar companies?
- A detailed ROI calculation specific to your numbers?
- Time to evaluate other options?

Let's schedule a follow-up for [date] to address any remaining questions."
